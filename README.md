# APD Module Interface Application

## Project Overview

Welcome to the repository for the APD Module Interface Application, a project by Quark Optical. This application is designed to facilitate the control and data acquisition of our APD (Avalanche Photodiode) Module. Developed using PyQt6, this interface provides an intuitive and user-friendly experience for interacting with the APD Module, allowing users to monitor and manage high-speed, precise light detection tasks effectively.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Acquisition:** Continuously monitor light intensity data converted into electrical signals by the APD Module.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Intuitive design built with PyQt6 for easy navigation and operation.
- **Graphical Data Representation:** Visualize data using integrated matplotlib graphs for better analysis and interpretation.
- **Configuration Options:** Configure the APD Module settings directly from the application.
- **Status Monitoring:** Real-time updates and status monitoring to ensure optimal performance of the APD Module.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/QuarkOptical/Quark-Optical-APD-Module-Interface.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Quark-Optical-APD-Module-Interface
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. Connect the APD Module to your system.
3. Use the interface to start data acquisition and monitor the light intensity signals.
