## COM Port Selection Section

The COM Port Selection section allows you to specify the serial port to which your APD Module is connected. This is a crucial step to ensure proper communication between the application and the module.

### Steps to Select a COM Port

1. **Locate the COM Port Selection Dropdown:**
    - Open the APD Module Interface Application.
    - The COM Port Selection Dropdown is located at the top left of the main window.

2. **Identify the Correct COM Port:**
    - Ensure your APD Module is connected to your computer via the USB/Serial cable.
    - Note the COM port number assigned to your device. You can find this in your systemâ€™s Device Manager (Windows) or using the `ls /dev/tty.*` command (Mac/Linux).

3. **Select the COM Port:**
    - Click on the COM Port Selection Dropdown.
    - A list of available COM ports will appear.
    - Select the COM port corresponding to your APD Module (e.g., COM3, COM4, /dev/ttyUSB0).

4. **Refresh Connection:**
    -You can refresh the connected ports by clicking the "Refresh" button.


## Temperature Gauge Chart

The Temperature Gauge Chart section provides users with real-time temperature readings from the APD Module. This gauge allows users to monitor the temperature of the module, ensuring it operates within safe and optimal conditions.

### Steps to Use the Temperature Gauge Chart

1. **Locate the Temperature Gauge Chart:**
    - Open the APD Module Interface Application.
    - The Temperature Gauge Chart is prominently displayed on the main window, top left on the main window.

2. **Understand the Gauge Display:**
    - The gauge displays the current temperature of the APD Module.
    - It includes a needle that points to the current temperature value on a circular scale.
    - The scale is color-coded to indicate safe, warning, and danger temperature ranges.

3. **Reading the Temperature:**
    - The current temperature is indicated by the position on the gauge.
    - The exact temperature value be displayed numerically under the gauge.

4. **Monitoring Temperature:**
    - Continuously monitor the gauge to ensure the temperature remains within the safe range.
    - The safe range is typically marked in green.
    - The warning and danger ranges are marked in yellow and red, respectively.

### Actions Based on Temperature Readings

- **Safe Range (Green):**
  - If the temperature is within the green range, the APD Module is operating normally.

- **Warning Range (Yellow):**
  - If the temperature enters the yellow range, consider taking preventive actions to avoid overheating, such as improving ventilation or reducing the module's workload.

- **Danger Range (Red):**
  - If the temperature reaches the red range, immediate action is required. Turn off the APD Module to prevent damage and investigate the cause of the high temperature.

### Troubleshooting Temperature Issues

- **Gauge Not Updating:**
  - Ensure the APD Module is properly connected and the application is running.
  - Check for any error messages related to data acquisition.

- **Unusually High or Low Readings:**
  - Verify the sensor's connection and placement on the APD Module.
  - Ensure the module is not exposed to external temperature extremes.



- **Danger Range Example:**
